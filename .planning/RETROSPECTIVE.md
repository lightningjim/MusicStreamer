# Retrospective: MusicStreamer

## Milestone: v1.0 — MVP

**Shipped:** 2026-03-20
**Phases:** 4 | **Plans:** 8 | **Timeline:** 35 days (2026-02-13 → 2026-03-20)

### What Was Built

- Modular Python package from a ~512-line monolith (Phase 1)
- Live AND-composed search + provider/tag filtering with empty state (Phase 2)
- GStreamer ICY TAG bus → now-playing panel with live track titles and station logo (Phase 3)
- iTunes cover art with junk detection, session dedup, in-flight continuity (Phase 4)

### What Worked

- **TDD first on pure logic** — filter_utils.py and cover_art.py written test-first; caught edge cases (junk titles, encoding bugs) before wiring to GTK
- **Gtk.Stack pattern** — established in Phase 3 for logo slot, reused identically in Phase 4 for art slot; zero rethinking
- **GLib.idle_add pattern** — established Phase 3, copy-pasted Phase 4; cross-thread GTK updates are a solved problem now
- **Phase sequencing** — extracting the monolith first (Phase 1) made every subsequent phase a clean, well-scoped addition

### What Was Inefficient

- Phase 1 needed a gap-closure plan (01-03) for YouTube audio fix and edit button — could have been caught in planning
- Nyquist VALIDATION.md files created but never completed (`nyquist_compliant: false` on all phases) — overhead with no payoff for this project scale

### Patterns Established

- `GLib.idle_add` + daemon threading for any background → GTK UI update
- `Gtk.Stack("fallback"/"content")` for slot widgets that can show placeholder or real content
- `uv run --with pytest` as the test runner (no system pip, no venv activation)
- `_last_cover_icy`-style string dedup for avoiding redundant API calls on repeated signals

### Key Lessons

- ICY encoding (latin-1 mojibake) is real — the `_fix_icy_encoding` heuristic handles the common case
- iTunes Search API is keyless and fast enough for per-track cover art; rate limits not hit in practice
- GTK downscale artifacts are real — always pre-scale with GdkPixbuf before `set_from_pixbuf`

### Cost Observations

- Model mix: mostly sonnet (executor, checker, researcher); opus for planner
- Nyquist auditor never invoked — VALIDATION.md files were stubs only
- Sessions: ~8 across 35 days
