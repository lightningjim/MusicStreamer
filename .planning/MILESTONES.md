# Milestones

## v1.1 Polish & Station Management (Shipped: 2026-03-21)

**Phases completed:** 2 phases, 4 plans | **Stats:** 58 tests | 1,782 Python LOC | 27 commits | 1 day

**Delivered:** Fixed GTK markup escaping for ICY titles, surfaced station logos in the list, added delete station, per-station ICY disable, and YouTube thumbnail auto-fetch.

**Key accomplishments:**

- GTK markup escaping: `&`, `<`, `>` in ICY titles and station names display as literal characters
- Station logo pre-loaded into cover art slot as default; junk ICY title no longer clears it
- Station list always shows 48px prefix widget — logo when available, generic icon otherwise
- `Station.icy_disabled` field, SQLite migration, repo CRUD, and MainWindow playback guard for per-station ICY suppression
- Delete Station in edit dialog with playing guard (blocks deletion while streaming) and confirmation dialog
- YouTube URL auto-fetch: entering a YT URL triggers yt-dlp thumbnail fetch with spinner feedback

## v1.0 MVP (Shipped: 2026-03-20)

**Phases completed:** 4 phases, 8 plans, 0 tasks

**Delivered:** Transformed a monolithic GTK4/Python radio player into a modular, feature-rich app with live search/filter, ICY metadata display, and iTunes cover art.

**Stats:** 4 phases | 8 plans | 43 tests | 1,409 Python LOC | 74 files changed | 35 days

**Key accomplishments:**

- Refactored ~512-line `main.py` monolith into clean `musicstreamer/` package (constants, models, repo, assets, player, UI)
- TDD filter engine with real-time AND-composed search + provider/tag dropdowns and empty-state handling
- GStreamer ICY TAG bus wired to now-playing panel — live track titles with latin-1 mojibake correction
- Three-column now-playing panel: station logo (left), track info + Stop (center), cover art (right)
- iTunes Search API cover art with junk title detection, session dedup, and smooth in-flight transitions
- 43 automated tests across 4 modules; zero regressions across all phases
