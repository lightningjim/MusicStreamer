# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-03 after v1.3 milestone)

**Core value:** Finding and playing a stream should take seconds — the right station should always be one or two clicks away.
**Current focus:** Planning next milestone (v1.4)

## Current Position

Phase: Not started (defining requirements)
Plan: —
Next: Define requirements, create roadmap, then `/gsd:plan-phase 16`
Last activity: 2026-04-03 — Milestone v1.4 started

Progress: v1.4 in planning

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 30 (v1.0–v1.3)
- Average duration: ~14 min
- Total execution time: ~7 hours

**Recent Trend:**

- Last 8 plans (v1.3): backend+UI splits across 4 phases
- Trend: Stable

*Updated after each plan completion*

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.

Key decisions added in v1.3:
- [Phase 12]: `last_itunes_result` module-level dict caches genre for favorites without a second API call
- [Phase 12]: `Adw.ToggleGroup` with `notify::active-name` for native Adwaita view switching
- [Phase 13]: `url_resolved` preferred over `url` from Radio-Browser API (url is often PLS/M3U)
- [Phase 14]: `is_live is True` strict identity check — non-live yt-dlp entries return None not False
- [Phase 14]: Thread-local `db_connect()` in import workers — SQLite connections not shareable across threads
- [Phase 15]: `ch['key']` not `ch['name']` for AudioAddict PLS URL slug
- [Phase 15]: `ValueError('no_channels')` sentinel for expired API keys returning 200+empty
- [Phase 15]: Resolve PLS to direct URL in `aa_import.fetch_channels` — GStreamer cannot play PLS playlists

### Pending Todos

- .planning/notes/2026-03-21-sdr-live-radio-support.md
- .planning/notes/2026-03-21-sync-config-between-computers.md
- .planning/notes/2026-03-20-icy-override-per-station.md
- .planning/notes/2026-03-22-favorite-songs-from-icy.md (completed in v1.3 — archive this note)

### Blockers/Concerns

None.

### Known Tech Debt (v1.3)

- DISC-03 cosmetic: stale now-playing state after preview close when nothing was previously playing; fix: call `main_window._stop()` instead of `player.stop()` directly in `discovery_dialog.py _on_close_request`
- `cover_art._parse_artwork_url` (lines 53–64) — dead code; superseded by `_parse_itunes_result` (Phase 12). Safe to delete.
- Nyquist compliance partial for phases 13–15 — VALIDATION.md files exist but wave_0 incomplete
